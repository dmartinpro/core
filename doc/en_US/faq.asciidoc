There is no standard time, it depends on the system and the data volume, so it may take more than 5 minutes, which is normal.

'''

Jeedom has a version of the web application for mobile and tablet. A native mobile application is being developed by the team right now, but no release date has been announced yet.
It is quite possible that third-party developers realized dedicated applications for Jeedom.

'''
What are the credentials to use at login the first time?::
When you first connect to Jeedom (and beyond if you don't change it) the user name is admin and the default password is admin.
At the first connection, it is strongly recommended to change these identifiers for better security.

'''
How to use an external database?::
Just edit the file /usr/share/nginx/www/jeedom/core/config/common.config.php.
In this file is the configuration of the database :

[source,php]
    $CONFIG = array(
        //MySQL parameters
        'db' => array(
            'host' => 'localhost',
            'port' => 3306,
            'dbname' => 'jeedom',
            'username' => 'jeedom',
            'password' => '************',
        )
    );

Simply change the settings according to the IDs of the Jeedom database on the MySQL server.
Perform these modifications:

[source,bash]
sudo php /usr/share/nginx/www/jeedom/install/install.php

Voila!

Impossible to access Jeedom from to the outside after purchasing a box::
By default Jeedom is running at the root of Nginx on a box. You do not have to add /jeedom/ in the access address. The exact address will be: your_public_ip:your_port/

'''
Can Jeedom be accessed over HTTPS?::
Yes, 3 possibilities:
* You have a pack power or more, simply use the Jeedom DNS.
* You already have a DNS name and you know how to produce a certificate, in this case it is a standard certificate installation.
* You do not have a DNS, and you do not mind using a self-signed certificate (remember that a self-signed certificate encrypts the data but does not provide the validation of the site), in this case follows the steps below, if using HTTPS is not already working:

[source,bash]
sudo su -
/usr/share/nginx/www/jeedom/install/install.sh nginx_ssl

You can then force HTTPS in the Jeedom configuration.

'''
I get the message: "You have too many Jeedom systems declared, please reduce the number and ask for a reset of your installation key". What should I do?::
Go on the Market, log in with your account then go to your profiles page and ask for a reset of the installation keys.

'''
What "event only" and "lifetime cache" means?::
* Event only: tells Jeedom to never request the value (it is the device / module that provides it). So when receiving a value, it is set as infinite lifetime (until reception of the next one).
* Lifetime cache: how long a value is valid, if you put 60 seconds for example, when the value get older than 60 sec AND jeedom needs the value (dashboard, scenario ...) then it will ask for the device / module to get an updated value.

Please note that these 2 options are reserved for advanced users who understand their function, a configuration error there can make the system unstable at worse inoperative. Eg with Zwave, RFXCOM and enocean the "event" box should ALWAYS be checked.

'''
How can I reset the permissions ?::
Connect with SSH and do the following: 
[source,bash]
sudo su -
chmod -R 775 /usr/share/nginx/www/jeedom
chown -R www-data:www-data /usr/share/nginx/www/jeedom

'''
